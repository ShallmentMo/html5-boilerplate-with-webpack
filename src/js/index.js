// Uncomment these to require the file you want. But something wrong happen with modernizr, I can't figure it out. Maybe you should put it in public folder
// Maybe I should use Babel too, but I am not quite sure.
// require("./vendor/modernizr-2.8.3.min.js");
// require("./vendor/jquery-1.11.2.min.js");
// require("./plugins.js");

// Add your javascript code here or another file
